= Setting up Smackage
:source-highlighter: pygments

Setting up Smackage is relatively straightforward. Launch a terminal emulator and follow along.

== Compiling Smackage

First, we'll clone the Smackage repository into a temporary directory.

[source, bash]
----
cd /tmp
git clone git://github.com/standardml/smackage.git 
----

Now we'll compile Smackage using MLton.

[source, bash]
----
cd smackage
make mlton
----

This creates an executable in the +bin+ subdirectory.
